# Join the ISB Lab

We are looking for highly motivated students who are excited to work in integrative structural biology. The lab is an interdisciplinary environment and currently has students from biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering backgrounds. Folks who'd like to cross-train (e.g., biologists who are curious about programming, or computer scientists who'd like to develop tools for biology) are most welcome.

 
For most of these positions, students must be willing to do computer programming. Prior programming background is helpful, but an analytical bent of mind, curiosity, and initiative are more important. In some projects, there are opportunities to do both computational modeling and cell biology/structural biology experiments. 

 
##### Currently, we have the following open positions. Please email your CV and a short (half-page) research proposal on the projects you are interested in working on.

1. *Masters thesis student (structural biology, computation)*: Must be willing to commit a minimum of one year in the lab. 

2. *PhD student*: Students with national fellowships (CSIR-NET, GATE, and others) are welcome to apply.
