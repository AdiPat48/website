# Join us!

We welcome highly motivated students who are excited to work in integrative structural biology. Â We combine protein structural modeling with cell biology and biophysics/biochemistry experiments (mass spectrometry/cryo-electron microscopy/tomography) in close collaborations with other labs on campus and elsewhere. Students in the group work on a spectrum of projects from computational method development to modeling specific assemblies to cell biology/biochemistry experiments. <br><br>

The lab is an interdisciplinary environment and has had students from biology (biochemistry, Biotech, microbiology), medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering backgrounds. Folks who'd like to cross-train (e.g., biologists who are curious about programming, or computer scientists who'd like to develop tools for biology) are most welcome. <br><br>

For most of these positions, students must be willing to do computer programming. Prior programming background is helpful, but an analytical bent of mind, curiosity, and initiative are more important. In a few projects, there are opportunities to do both computational modeling and cell biology/structural biology experiments. <br><br>

### MSc thesis/PhD positions

 Currently, we have the following open positions. Please email your CV and a short (2-3 paragraphs) research proposal on the projects you are interested in working on.

1. *Masters thesis student (structural biology, computation)*: Must be willing to commit a minimum of one year in the lab and have prior programming experience.

2. *PhD student*:  If you are interested in doing a PhD in the lab, please get in touch. PhD students usually come in via the NCBS admissions process. Students with national fellowships (CSIR-NET, GATE, and others) can also register for a PhD in the lab.

### JRF, Project Assistant, and intern positions

Summer internship positions (2022) are currently filled. <br><br>
We also do not have short-term project assistant/JRF/intern positions right now. <br><br>
